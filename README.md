# Superhat
Planes in modern combat flight simulators have two or three MFDs - square displays that have five buttons on each side (for a total of twenty buttons). To access these buttons, a user must either use their mouse inside the sim, or buy multiple expensive hardware devices. Further, in some situations it is not convenient to have to take your hand off the joystick to press an MFD button.

Superhat allows a single joystick 'hat' (a four-way button) to navigate the MFDs and press their buttons - a long press to the left or right 'selects' which MFD is active. Any further short press selects which edge of the MFD is selected, then you can select which of the five buttons using further inputs - you can imagine the first press selects the middle button, then you can move the selection to adjacent buttons by pushing in that direction. You confirm a selection by pushing in the direction you started.

For example, to select OSB 4 (the fourth button from the left on the top row of the left MFD), you would press the hat up to select the top side, then press the hat right once to select the fourth button, then up to press the button. If you wanted to press the fifth button after the initial side selection, you would only have to press right twice, with the second press pushing the button - the up is not necessary.

To use the software, run it and press the 'b' key to enter binding mode, then enter your hat directions. When an OSB is pressed, the software will emit Falcon BMS keyboard shortcuts for the OSBs (you should be able to map these in DCS)
