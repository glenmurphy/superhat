Planes in modern combat flight simulators have two or three MFDs - square displays that have five buttons on each side (for a total of twenty buttons). To access these buttons, a user must either use their mouse inside the sim, or buy multiple expensive hardware devices.

Superhat allows a single joystick 'hat' (a four-way button) to navigate the MFDs and press their buttons - a long press to the left or right 'selects' which MFD is active. A subsequent short press in any four directions starts the button-pressing mode and selects which side of the MFD, then you can select which of the five buttons using subsequent inputs using a spatial model.

For example, to select OSB 4 (the fourth button from the left on the top row of the left MFD), you would press the hat up to select the top side, then press the hat right once to select the fourth button, then up to press the button.

To use the software, run it and press the 'b' key to enter binding mode, then enter your hat directions. When an OSB is pressed, the software will emit Falcon BMS keyboard shortcuts for the OSBs (you should be able to map these in DCS)
